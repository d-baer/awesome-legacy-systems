**What is a "Legacy System"?**  

> A legacy is something *valuable* that you have *inherited*. Similarly, legacy software is valuable software that you have inherited. The fact you have inherited it may mean that it is somewhat old-fashioned. It may have been developed using an outdated programming language, or an obsolete development method. Most likely it has changed hands several times, and shows signs of many modifications and adaptations.
