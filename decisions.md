# Decisions

Here we document significant decisions made that influence this curated list.

**These decisions should be seen as guidelines for changes to this list. They are not unchangeable and can be discussed at any time.**


## No section for tools
ID: 001  
Decision maker: @feststelltaste  
Date: 14/02/2022  
Status: ACCEPTED

### Context
There are plenty of tools out there that support analyzing legacy systems.

### Problem
There are too many tools to list, which could make the list too crowded and costly to maintain. The focus should be more towards the ideas and experiences from practioners. Other awesome lists already list those tools, too.

### Decision
There will be no section that lists tools for now. 

### Consequences
\+ Focussing more on practices and approaches  
\+ Avoiding too many changes because of the listing of new tools  
\- Beginners in this area might not know which tools to use, but tools are often mentioned in the already listed resources  

### Compensations for negative effects
We add a meta section for the lists that list those tools already.

## Focus on English content only

Date: 15/02/2022  
Status: ACCEPTED

### Context
This awesome list lists some resources that are only available in other languages than English.

### Problem
Other languages than English are not known to the audience of this list.

### Decision
Remove any non-english resources. Create sub lists for specific languages.

### Consequences
\+ Narrowing the focus on a specific group of people with an english-only awesome list as main entry point
0 Awesome lists in other languages compensate possible information loss  
\- Valuable resources from other languages get lost if no non-english-specific lists is created. 

### Compensations for negative effects
We keep lists in other languages in the same repository as the list in English to keep the overhead of creating lists for additional languages as small as possible. We also provide a list in German as an example that lists in other languages can adapt.
