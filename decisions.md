## No section for tools

Status: ACCEPTED

### Context
There are plenty of tools out there that support analyzing legacy systems.

### Problem
There are too many tools to list, which could make the list too crowded and costly to maintain. The focus should be more towards the ideas and experiences from practioners. Other awesome lists already list those tools, too.

### Decision
There will be no section that lists tools for now. We add a meta section for the lists that list those tools already.

### Consequences
\+ Focussing more on practices and approaches 
\+ Avoiding too many changes because of the listing of new tools
\- Beginners in this area might not know which tools to use, but tools are often mentioned in the already listed resources
